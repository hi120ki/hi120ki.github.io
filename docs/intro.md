# Introduction

This documentation serves as a comprehensive collection of my personal notes and technical references across various domains of modern IT and security. The goal is to provide practical, hands-on knowledge, checklists, and tool usage guides for both learning and real-world application.

Whether you are preparing for certifications, working on professional projects, or simply seeking to deepen your understanding, you will find curated resources, step-by-step guides, and actionable tips throughout these sections.

> **Disclaimer:** All techniques and tools described here must only be used in authorized environments and resources (e.g., systems you own, official training labs, or designated practice environments). Never attempt to use these methods on unauthorized systems or third-party resources. Always act ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
