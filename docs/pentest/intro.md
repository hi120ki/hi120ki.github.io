# Introduction

Penetration testing is a critical hands-on skill in the field of information security. This documentation is specifically designed for **educational purposes** and for those aiming to obtain **certifications** (such as OSCP).
All techniques and tools described here **must only be used in authorized environments and resources** (e.g., systems you own, official training labs, or designated practice environments).

**Never attempt to use these methods on unauthorized systems or third-party resources. Doing so is illegal and may result in severe consequences.**
Always act ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
