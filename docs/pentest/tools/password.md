# Password Wordlists & Tools

This page summarizes common password and username wordlists, as well as tools and tips for password cracking and brute force attacks during penetration testing.

## Common Wordlists

### Password Lists

- **Top 100 passwords:**
  - `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/adobe_top100_pass.txt`
- **3,500 passwords:**
  - `/usr/share/john/password.lst`
- **14 million passwords:**
  - `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

> **Tip:** Try `john/password.lst` first, then `rockyou.txt`. If `rockyou.txt` doesn't work, brute force is probably not the intended solution.

### Username Lists

- **Top 17 usernames:**
  - `/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt`
- **835 default usernames:**
  - `/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/cirt-default-usernames.txt`
- **624,000 usernames:**
  - `/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames-dup.txt`

### Default Credentials

- Default username/password lists:
  - `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/`

## Password Cracking & Decryption

### Online Services

- [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/): Supports LM, NTLM, MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, and more.

### John the Ripper

- [John format details (gist)](https://gist.github.com/hi120ki/2654054e7418cdc3c2437f593e120f9d)

```bash
john --format=krb5tgs hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### Hashcat

- [Hash type list](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)

```bash
hashcat -m 13100 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

## Web Directory Wordlists

- **3,000 entries:** `/usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/general/big.txt`
- **20,000 entries:** `/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt`

## Wordlist Generation

- Generate a wordlist from a website:

```bash
cewl -w cewl_passlist.txt 10.11.1.1/index.html
html2dic index.html | sort -u > index.dict
```
