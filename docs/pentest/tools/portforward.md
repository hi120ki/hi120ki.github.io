# Port Forwarding

Port forwarding is a technique used to tunnel network connections through an intermediate host. This is useful for pivoting and accessing internal resources during penetration testing.

## SSH Port Forwarding

- [sshuttle (Python 2.4+)](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle/releases/tag/v0.78.1): Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man's VPN over SSH.

## Non-SSH Methods

(Describe other port forwarding tools or techniques as needed)
